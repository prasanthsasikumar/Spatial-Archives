# Spatial-Archives
A Unity project demonstrating dynamic instantiation and orientation of 3D cards in mixed reality. Cards are generated in a circular layout around a central point (e.g., the player), automatically face inward, and support nested TextMeshPro components for customizable text content. Ideal for MR/VR dashboards, card-based interfaces, or educational visualization tools.
